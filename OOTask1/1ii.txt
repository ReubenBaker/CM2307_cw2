(a) Using abstract classes has several advantages in this program. Firstly, it allows us to define a common interface for all pets, while also providing some implementation details that can be reused by all subclasses. This minimises code duplication, and makes the code easier to maintain. Secondly, it allows us to enforce certain rules across all subclasses, such as the requirement for every pet to have a name. However, one disadvantage of using abstract classes is that they can lead to a rigid class hierarchy, making it difficult to add new types of pets or change the existing ones.

(b) Using interfaces instead of abstract classes would make the code more flexible and allow for multiple inheritance. For example, we could define separate interfaces for animals that can fly and animals that can swim, and have a class implement both interfaces. However, interfaces do not provide any implementation details, so each subclass would need to implement all the methods defined in the interface, even if they are common across many subclasses. This can lead to code duplication and increase the complexity of the program. Additionally, interfaces cannot define fields, so any common state that needs to be shared across subclasses would need to be managed separately.
