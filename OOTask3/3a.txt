Description:

The program consists of a card game and a dice game. The card game shuffles a deck of 52 cards and asks the user to choose two cards at random from the deck. If one of the cards is an Ace, the user wins, otherwise, they lose. The dice game asks the user to roll two dice and records the result. If the user rolls a 7 or 11, they win, otherwise, they lose.

Critique:

The program is poorly designed and implemented. There is a lack of cohesion between the different methods, and the number of classes is not appropriate for the program. The game entities are not modeled as objects, and there is a heavy use of static variables, which makes the program difficult to read and understand.

The card game and the dice game should be separated into different classes, with their own methods and variables. The use of a BufferedReader and a RandomInterface is unnecessary, and the shuffling of the deck should be encapsulated in a separate class.

In the card game, the choice of cards is poorly implemented, as it can choose the same card twice, and there is no check for a user input error. The declareCardGameWinner method should return a Boolean value indicating whether the user has won or lost, rather than printing a message to the console.

In the dice game, the number of rolls is not specified, and there is no check for a user input error. The declareDieGameWinner method should return a Boolean value indicating whether the user has won or lost, rather than printing a message to the console.
